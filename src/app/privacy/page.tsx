        <p>
          BondScape is a mobile application designed for event management and
          connection building, seamlessly integrating with the{" "}
          <a href="https://desmos.network/">Desmos Blockchain</a>. Our platform
          empowers users to create decentralized and portable profiles, giving
          them complete ownership and control over their Memories and Bonds.
          While our long-term vision includes decentralization, for the initial
          MVP phase, these features are centralized to ensure a
          faster-development pace and test out the features with beta testers.
          With BondScape, users can create meaningful Memories and forge strong
          Bonds, all within a secure and user-centric environment.
