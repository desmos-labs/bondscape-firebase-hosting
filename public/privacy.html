<!-- Privacy Policy -->

<p><strong>Last updated: 2 Jun 2023</strong></p>
<p>This policy describes the privacy practices of Bondscape and related content, features, and functionality
  (collectively, the “ <strong>Platform”</strong> ) and
  the various services that we offer to you on or through the Platform (the “ <strong>Services</strong> ”). Users of our
  Services are referred to as “ <strong>users</strong> ” or
  “you”.</p>
<p><strong>Please read this policy and the Bondscape Terms of Service carefully before engaging with the Platform or
  using the Services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are uncomfortable with the immutable, permanent and transparent nature of entries on a blockchain, you
  should not
  engage with the Platform or use the Services.</strong></p>
<p>By engaging with our Platform and using our Services, you accept the privacy practices as set out in this policy, as
  may be modified or
  supplemented from time to time. If you are engaging with our Platform or using our Services as a representative of an
  organisation, you are
  accepting these practices on their behalf.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this policy or any privacy issues related to your use of our Services, please contact
  us by email to

<h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
<p>BondScape is a mobile application designed for event management and connection building, seamlessly integrating with
  the <a href="https://desmos.network/">Desmos
    Blockchain</a>. Our platform empowers users to create decentralized and portable profiles, giving them complete
  ownership and control over
  their Memories and Bonds. While our long-term vision includes decentralization, for the initial MVP phase, these
  features are centralized to
  ensure a faster-development pace and test out the features with beta testers. With BondScape, users can create
  meaningful Memories and
  forge strong Bonds, all within a secure and user-centric environment.</p>
<p>Desmos Labs Limited is a company incorporated in Hong Kong with company registration number 3210522, having its
  registered office at
  Flat 3B, Tontex Industrial Building, 2-4 Sheung Hei Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection-and-data-retention">Data Collection and Data Retention</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this policy, “ <strong>personal data</strong> ” refers to any information which is related to an
  identified or identifiable natural person.
  “Personal data” and “personal information” are used interchangeably.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>
<p>Previous explicit approval from you, the information we automatically collect from you through the Services (or
  third-party services we
  engage) includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>information about content that you create, such as any memories&#39; or events&#39; likes, comments you publish or
    memories you collect on
    our Platform or our Services;
  </li>
  <li>information about your computer or mobile device that you use to access our Platform or our Services, such as
    device information,
    unique identifiers, operating system and timezone.
    <ol>
      <li>These informations are collected through a third-party, open-source service: PostHog.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>information about your online activities and actions on the Platform, such as your usage data, navigation path,
    frequency of visit and

    <ol>
      <li>These informations are collected through a third-party, open-source service: PostHog.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In the future, we may use Firebase to handle in-app notifications for our users. Firebase may collect certain
  information from our users,
  including device information, unique identifiers, and interaction data.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to the immutable, permanent and transparent nature of blockchain protocols and
  applications, you must carefully consider what
  information you choose to publish about yourself (through the creation of the Profile) or share with others, since you
  may not be able to
  erase, remove or delete it, nor control who has access to it.</p>
<p>We <strong>do not collect</strong> sensitive data or special category data about you. This includes details about
  your race, ethnic origin, politics, religion,
  trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health, or sexual orientation.</p>

  <li>We only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which your personal

    user and are not
    stored in any centralized or online service. The private keys will be deleted from the device upon the deletion of

  System or similar

  endeavours (such as by entering into contractual terms) to safeguard the security of the information transferred.</p>
