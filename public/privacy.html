<h1>Bondscape Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated: 2 Jun 2023</strong></p>

<p>This policy describes the privacy practices of Bondscape and related content, features, and functionality
  (collectively, the "Platform") and the various services that we offer to you on or through the Platform (the
  "Services"). Users of our Services are referred to as "users" or "you".</p>

<p><strong>Please read this policy and the Bondscape Terms of Service carefully before engaging with the Platform or
  using the Services.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you are uncomfortable with the immutable, permanent, and transparent nature of entries on a blockchain,
  you should not engage with the Platform or use the Services.</strong></p>

<p>By engaging with our Platform and using our Services, you accept the privacy practices as set out in this policy, as
  may be modified or supplemented from time to time. If you are engaging with our Platform or using our Services as a
  representative of an organization, you are accepting these practices on their behalf.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this policy or any privacy issues related to your use of our Services, please contact
  us by email to <strong>privacy@desmos.network</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="about">About us</h2>

<p>BondScape is a mobile application designed for event management and connection building, seamlessly integrating with
  the <a href="https://desmos.network/">Desmos Blockchain</a>. Our platform empowers users to create decentralized and
  portable profiles, giving them complete ownership and control over their Memories and Bonds. While our long-term
  vision includes decentralization, for the initial MVP phase, these features are centralized to ensure a
  faster-development pace and test out the features with beta testers. With BondScape, users can create meaningful
  Memories and forge strong Bonds, all within a secure and user-centric environment.</p>

<p>Desmos Labs Limited is a company incorporated in Hong Kong with company registration number 3210522, having its
  registered office at Flat 3B, Tontex Industrial Building, 2-4 Sheung Hei Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection-and-retention">Data Collection and Data Retention</h2>

<p>For the purpose of this policy, "<strong>personal data</strong>" refers to any information which is related to an
  identified or identifiable natural person. "Personal data" and "personal information" are used interchangeably.</p>

<h3 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h3>

<p>Previous explicit approval from you, the information we automatically collect from you through the Services (or
  third-party services we engage) includes:</p>

    memories you collect on our Platform or our Services;
  </li>
  <li>Information about your computer or mobile device that you use to access our Platform or our Services, such as
    device information, unique identifiers, operating system, and timezone.

    </ol>

<p>In the future, we may use Firebase to handle in-app notifications for our users. Firebase may collect certain
  information from our users, including device information, unique identifiers, and interaction data.</p>

  applications, you must carefully consider what information you choose to publish about yourself (through the creation
  of the Profile) or share with others, since you may not be able to erase, remove, or delete it, nor control who has
  access to it.</p>

<p>We <strong>do not collect</strong> sensitive data or special category data about you. This includes details about
  your race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health, or sexual

<p>However, due to the immutable, permanent, and transparent nature of blockchain protocols and applications, we are
