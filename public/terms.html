<h1>Bondscape Terms of Service</h1>

<p>The following terms and conditions govern your access to and use of the Bondscape application, and any related
  content, products, and services offered by Desmos Labs Limited (collectively, the “<strong>Platform</strong>”).
  <strong>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using our Platform.</strong></p>

<p>The Platform is operated by Desmos Labs Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong with company registration number
  3210522, having its registered office at Flat 3B, Tontex Industrial Building, 2-4 Sheung Hei Street, San Po Kong,
  Kowloon, Hong Kong (“<strong>Desmos Labs</strong>”, “we” or “us”). Users of our services are referred to as “<strong>users</strong>”
  or “you”.</p>

<p>By using our Platform, you agree to be legally bound by these terms and conditions, as they may be modified or
  supplemented from time to time (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”). If you are accessing or using our Platform as a
  representative of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms on their behalf. Desmos Labs and users are referred
  to as “parties” in these Terms.</p>

<h2 id="platform">Our Platform</h2>

<p>Bondscape is an application that seamlessly integrates the Desmos Blockchain to provide users with decentralized
  profiles, connections (relationships between users), and assets (NFTs, tokens) granting them total and complete
  ownership over them.</p>

<p>Bondscape does not collect your personal data (such as your email address or your mobile phone number) when you
  create your Bondscape profile or when you use or interact with Bondscape. You are completely free to submit any
  information about yourself. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for details on how we handle any personal data we
  receive from you.</p>

<p>Each profile registered with Bondscape is only accessible by you. We don’t have access nor can we delete your profile
  or take control over it in any way.</p>

<p>Any data or transaction history that some of the Bondscape features perform is stored only on the Desmos Blockchain.
  We, Desmos Labs, and our officers and employees have no write access to your data or history. This means we can't edit
  or delete your content.</p>

<p>Due to the immutable nature of blockchain networks and applications, actions related to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Profile creation or edit;</li>
  <li>Memories creation, collection, and in the future comments;</li>
  <li>Bonds' creation, removal;</li>
</ol>

<p>will always leave an immutable record of that specific action inside the Desmos Blockchain.</p>

<p>We may update, upgrade, improve, or change any functions or features of Bondscape, and any other related products or
  services we offer from time to time. We may also change or discontinue any of the products or services we offer or
  add, remove, or modify functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop certain products, services,
  functionalities, or features altogether.</p>
