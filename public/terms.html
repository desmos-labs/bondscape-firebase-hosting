    our Platform.</strong></p>
<p>The Platform is operated by Desmos Labs Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong with company registration number

  time (these “ <strong>Terms</strong> ”). If you are accessing or using our Platform as a representative of an
  organisation, you are agreeing to these Terms on
  their behalf. Desmos Labs and users are referred to as “parties” in these Terms.</p>

<h2 id="our-platform">Our Platform</h2>

  services we offer
  from time to time. We may also change or discontinue any of the products or services we offer, or add, remove or
